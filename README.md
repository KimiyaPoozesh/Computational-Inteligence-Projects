# Phase 1 - Clustering Analysis Project

This project focuses on clustering analysis as an initial phase of a larger AI or data science initiative. It aims to find a suitable clustering algorithm, visualize clusters, and evaluate clustering performance.

## Project Overview

1. **Clustering and Visualization**  
   - Identify and apply a clustering algorithm that best fits the dataset.
   - Visualize clusters by plotting data points with distinct colors.
   - Adjust clustering parameters to assess the quality of the clusters visually.

2. **Domain Identification**  
   - Determine the number of distinct domains represented by the data.
   - Analyze which domain each cluster signifies, helping to inform further data processing steps.

3. **Cluster Evaluation**  
   - Evaluate clusters using labeled data through train-test splits.
   - Assess clustering performance by measuring accuracy against test data labels.


A report of each phase is included in the Report folder

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. **Run Clustering Scripts**: Execute clustering and visualization with the provided scripts.
3. **Evaluate Clustering**: Use labeled data for testing and validating clustering results.
